# SAiL-Sorter Instructions
Export the Google Forms sheet and a sheet containing the capacities of each section into .csv format. Launch the program, import each file into their respective field, and click execute. A file labeled 'results.csv' will be generated.
The Master SAiL CSV is a sample of what the form results should look like.  You'll also need a capacity one with the capacity of each SAiL.
